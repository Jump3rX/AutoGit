# **AutoGit**
This is a simple tool to "automate" commits to new repositories. Got tired of having to write the commit commands. It still need some work to refactor and add new features.Version 2 coming soon!

# How To Use
At the moment it is a python script, I intend to make it an executable (.exe) file at a later update.
1. Install python on your system https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Navigate to the file using cmd and type 'python auto_git.py' to run the script.

# Features
At the moment you can use AutoGit to clone a repo and commit files to a repository.
- To clone, provide a file path to where you want to files to be saved and the link to the repository you want to clone
- To commit files, provide a path to the files you wish to commit and the repository url.
