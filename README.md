# **AutoGit**
This is a python tool to "automate" commits to new repositories, It still need some work to refactor the code and add new features. Version 2 coming soon!

# How To Use
At the moment it is a python script, I intend to make it an executable (.exe) file at a later update.
1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system
2. Navigate to the file using cmd and type
``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the required packages.
``` python auto_git.py``` to run the script.

# Features
At the moment you can use AutoGit to clone a repo, commit files to new repo and create a branch and commit files.
- To clone, provide a file path to where you want to save the files and the link to the repository you want to clone.
- To commit files, provide a path to the files you wish to commit and the repository url.
- To add a branch and commit files, provide a path to the files you wish to commit and the new branch name.
